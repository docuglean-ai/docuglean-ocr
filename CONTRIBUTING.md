## How to contribute

This project follows a [Fork/Feature Branch/Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) workflow. Here's how it works:

1. **Fork the project:** Create a personal copy of the repository on your GitHub account.
2. **Clone your fork:** Bring a copy of your fork to your local machine.

   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/docuglean.git
   ```
3. **Create a new branch**: Start a new branch for your changes
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Make your changes**: Implement the changes you wish to contribute.
5. **Push your changes**: Upload your changes to your fork.
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
6. **Create a pull request**: Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch against the `main` branch.
   - Use semantic commit conventions (e.g. `feat: add new feature`, `fix: correct issue with X`)
   - Include a clear description of your changes
   - Reference any relevant issues
